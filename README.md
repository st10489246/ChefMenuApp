### Changes Made based Feedback(08 November 2025)
* Corrected tab icon logic: replaced "Add Book" with "Add Menu" so the correct icon now displays on the Add tab.
* Fixed style crash: changed styles. box (with space) to styles.box.
* Added missing borderLeftWidth property so borderLeftColor now renders correctly
* Fixed inconsistent currency formatting — now all prices display as Rxx.xx with two decimals 
* Replaced index key in FlatList with a unique item ID to prevent rendering bugs during updates
